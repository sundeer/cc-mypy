# Open Source License Repository

This directory holds the license files for the commonly used Open Source licenses,
and also their short version used for embedding into source code files.
See [Choosing an OSS license doesnâ€™t need to be scary](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/)
for details on the characteristics of these licenses, and how to choose between them.

The license for this project (MIT) is in the base directory and called ``LICENSE``!
